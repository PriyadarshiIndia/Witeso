## 🌍 The Why Behind Witeso

In a small village in Uttar Pradesh, lives Anjali — a 20-year-old girl from a low-income household. Her father’s health doesn't allow him to work anymore, and her younger siblings are still in school. She isn’t dreaming of luxury — she’s dreaming of survival.

Anjali wants to become the first earning member of her family. She’s willing to learn any skill — customer service, data entry, teaching, or anything that can help her get hired. But all she finds online are:

1. Unfinished YouTube tutorials  
2. Irrelevant, overly advanced content  
3. Confusing courses with no clear job path  
4. No mentorship, no mock tests, no feedback  

> _She’s not lazy. She’s just lost and confused._

### 🎯 The Problem We’re Solving

Millions of youth — especially women from small towns and rural areas — want to work. But they’re trapped in a maze of:

- ❌ Unstructured learning  
- ❌ Lack of mentorship  
- ❌ No clarity on job paths  
- ❌ Weak resumes, zero interview prep  
- ❌ No confidence to even apply  

They don’t need motivation — they need direction.
